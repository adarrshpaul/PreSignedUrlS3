Pre-signed URLs for Amazon S3 Uploads
=====================================

This AWS CloudFormation template provides a solution for using pre-signed URLs to upload files to Amazon S3. The solution consists of an S3 bucket, a Lambda function, a DynamoDB table, and an API Gateway to expose the Lambda function as an HTTP API.

Prerequisites
-------------

-   An AWS account with the necessary permissions to create the resources defined in this template.
-   A basic understanding of AWS CloudFormation and AWS Lambda.

Getting Started
---------------

To use this template, follow these steps:

1.  Create an S3 bucket and replace `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME` in the CloudFormation template with your bucket name.
2.  Package and upload your Lambda function code to your S3 bucket, and replace `YOUR_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_CODE.zip` in the CloudFormation template with the name of your Lambda function code file.
3.  Replace `YOUR_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME` in the CloudFormation template with the name of your Lambda function.
4.  Create a DynamoDB table and replace `YOUR_TABLE_NAME` in the CloudFormation template with your table name.
5.  Replace `YOUR_INDEX_NAME` in the CloudFormation template with a unique name for your DynamoDB global secondary index.
6.  Deploy the CloudFormation template to create the necessary resources.

Resources
---------

The following resources are created by this CloudFormation template:

-   S3 bucket: An S3 bucket that is used to store uploaded files.
-   Lambda function: A Lambda function that generates pre-signed URLs for S3 uploads and stores upload metadata in a DynamoDB table.
-   DynamoDB table: A DynamoDB table that is used to store upload metadata.
-   IAM role: An IAM role that grants the Lambda function permissions to access S3 and DynamoDB.
-   API Gateway: An API Gateway that exposes the Lambda function as an HTTP API.
